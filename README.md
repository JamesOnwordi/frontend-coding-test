## Follow-Up Questions:

### If given more time, how would you improve the quality of your application? 

If I had more time to work on this project, I would incorporate a map to provide users with a visual representation of the different price ranges in various quadrants of Calgary. This could enhance the user experience and make the information more accessible.

### Would you implement anything differently?

Given another opportunity, I would use pure CSS for styling to leverage its flexibility and customization options. This might offer more control over the design and layout than using a framework.
